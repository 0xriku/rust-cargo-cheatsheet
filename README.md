# Cargo Cheatsheet

Sometimes you may find yourself forgetting these key Cargo commands while you work on your projects.

Here they are for your convenience:

* `cargo version`: Show version information to confirm Cargo is installed.
* `cargo new`: Create a new project.
* `cargo test`: Run unit tests within a project.
* `cargo check`: Quickly compile a project without producing a binary to check for errors.
* `cargo fmt`: Formats code automatically.
* `cargo build`: Compile a project.
* `cargo run`: Compile and run a project in one step.
* `cargo clippy --all-targets -- --D warnings`: Linter to check errors.
* `cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests`: Checks code coverage.

Note: Cargo commands are the same no matter which operating system you're working on.
